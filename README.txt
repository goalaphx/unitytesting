Hello this is my SunnyLand project
i started learning unity recently so its been very exciting.
i made a platformer level using the SunnyLand assets with enemies,collectibles and powerups.
this level can transition into a game over screen or a game complete screen.
theres probably a lot of bugs that i missed on fixing but hopefully on the next versions ill manage it out.
ill post my scripts here so people can see how i coded it out using C#
im planning to add more levels,enemies and other features so Stay Tuned :D
