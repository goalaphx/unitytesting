# unitytesting
Hello this is my first Unity project i used the Sunny Land assets to make a platformer type game with just one level at the moment.
this level has collectibles and enemies to make it more exciting and also a power up gem that makes you jump higher
i only managed to put a game over screen and a stage complete screen after u reach the house at the end of stage
i ve been learning unity for just 2 weeks and its very exciting to learn new stuff and apply it every time
Also theres probably a lot of bugs and ill try to fix them in the next versions hopefully ill be adding more levels/enemies/features to make it more polished
also im probably gonna work out on a 2D zelda like game so i might not end up updating this 
Thanks for Reading!!
